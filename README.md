# E-WasteREYCYCLE Trial Project

E-WasteREYCYCLE is a trial project built using HTML and CSS, designed to explore the basic structure and styling of a website. This project serves as a prototype for a similar idea that I planned to implement during my participation in a hackathon at IIT Guwahati. 

Through this project, I experimented with creating a visually appealing and informative platform for e-waste recycling awareness.
